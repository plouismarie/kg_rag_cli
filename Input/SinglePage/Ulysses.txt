Mount Ida, a majestic and forested mountain range, lies in close proximity to the fabled city of Troy, its peaks shrouded in myth and legend.
It is upon these slopes that Paris, a young Trojan prince raised as a shepherd, is approached by a divine delegation consisting of Hermes, the swift-footed messenger of the gods, and three radiant goddesses: Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty; Hera, queen of the gods and protector of marriage; and Athena, the wise and warlike deity of wisdom and strategy.
Hermes, acting under Zeus’s command to resolve a celestial dispute, presents Paris with a momentous task: to judge which of these goddesses is the most beautiful and thus worthy of the Golden Apple, a gleaming prize inscribed with the words "to the fairest." After careful deliberation—and swayed by Aphrodite’s irresistible promise to grant him the love of the world’s most beautiful woman—Paris awards the apple to Aphrodite, unknowingly setting in motion a chain of events that will lead to the catastrophic Trojan War.

Sparta, a formidable city-state in the Peloponnese region of Greece, is renowned for its disciplined warriors and austere way of life.
It is to this proud kingdom that Ulysses, the clever and resourceful king of Ithaca, journeys with a hopeful heart to seek the hand of Helen, the breathtakingly beautiful daughter of King Tyndareus.
Helen’s allure is so great that suitors from across the Greek world vie for her favor, but she ultimately chooses Menelaus, a powerful prince of Mycenae and brother to Agamemnon.
Though Ulysses is disappointed by her decision, he remains in Sparta for a time, his keen mind perhaps already turning to other prospects. During his stay, he meets and weds Penelope, the gentle and intelligent niece of King Tyndareus, whose steadfast loyalty and sharp wit will later prove to be his perfect match. With his new bride, Ulysses departs Sparta and returns to his rocky, windswept homeland of Ithaca, eager to build a life with her.

The Trojan War, one of the most legendary conflicts in history, takes its name from the prosperous and strategically vital city of Troy, located on the western shores of Asia Minor near the Dardanelles.
 This epic struggle erupts when Paris, emboldened by Aphrodite’s promise, travels to Sparta and absconds with Helen, now Menelaus’s wife, spiriting her away to Troy under the cover of passion or treachery, depending on the teller.
 Her abduction—whether an act of love or a calculated insult—ignites the fury of Menelaus and unites the Greek kings under a solemn oath, once sworn to Tyndareus, to defend Helen’s honor. Thus begins a decade-long siege, pitting the Achaean forces, including Ulysses, against the towering walls of Troy and its valiant defenders, a war immortalized in tales of heroism, betrayal, and divine meddling.

Mount Olympus, the lofty and ethereal abode of the Greek pantheon, rises high above the mortal world, its snow-capped summit piercing the heavens. It is here, amid golden halls and ambrosial feasts, that the gods and goddesses hold court, their immortal lives often entwined with human affairs.
Eris, the mischievous and spiteful goddess of discord, finds herself excluded from a grand banquet on Olympus, perhaps a wedding celebration for Peleus and Thetis. Incensed by the slight, she devises a cunning revenge, crafting the Golden Apple and inscribing it with the provocative phrase "to the fairest." She hurls this gleaming orb into the midst of the festivities, knowing full well that it will spark rivalry among Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena.
Her scheme succeeds beyond measure, as the goddesses’ quarrel escalates into a divine contest, ultimately dragging Paris and the mortal world into its turbulent wake.

Ithaca, a rugged and modest island in the Ionian Sea, serves as the cherished domain of Ulysses, who rules as its king with a blend of wisdom and tenacity.
After his marriage to Penelope, he settles into a peaceful life on this sun-drenched isle, where the couple welcomes their son, Telemachus, a child destined to grow up in his father’s long shadow.
Ulysses deeply loves his kingdom, with its olive groves, rocky shores, and loyal subjects, and he governs it with a steady hand. Yet, when the call to war arrives—summoned by the oath he himself devised to protect Helen’s suitors—he is torn from his idyllic existence
Reluctantly, he bids farewell to Penelope and Telemachus, setting sail for Troy with a heavy heart, his cunning mind already plotting ways to survive the trials ahead and return to the family and island he holds dear.
