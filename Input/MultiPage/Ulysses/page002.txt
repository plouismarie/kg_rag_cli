Page 2 – Helen and the Promise

In the palace of Sparta, the most beautiful woman in all Greece lived as queen. Helen, daughter of Zeus and Leda, was renowned throughout the known world for her unparalleled beauty. Kings and princes from distant lands had once competed for her hand, each vowing eternal friendship to whichever man she chose.

Helen of Sparta had chosen Menelaus, brother of the mighty Agamemnon, and became queen of his rich kingdom. For years, she lived in contentment, bearing a daughter and ruling alongside her husband. But the goddesses had not forgotten the judgment on Mount Ida, and Aphrodite's promise to Paris had yet to be fulfilled.

When Prince Paris arrived in Sparta as a diplomatic guest, helen welcomed him with the traditional hospitality of Greece. She could not have known that Aphrodite's divine influence was already working upon her heart. The goddess of love had decreed that Helen would abandon her homeland, her daughter, and her husband.

Soon, Helen of Sparta would sail away to Troy with the Trojan prince, and the armies of Greece would follow, determined to reclaim their stolen queen.
