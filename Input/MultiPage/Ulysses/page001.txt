Page 1 – The Judgment of Paris

On the slopes of Mount Ida, far from the mighty city of Troy, lived a young shepherd. Prince Paris, though he did not yet know his royal lineage, tended his flocks with care and devotion. The gods had ordained that PARIS would one day make a choice that would shake the foundations of the mortal world.

One fateful morning, as Paris watched his sheep graze, three goddesses descended upon the mountain. Hera, queen of the gods, offered him power over all kingdoms. Athena, goddess of wisdom, promised victory in all battles. But it was Aphrodite who captured his heart with her offer: the love of the most beautiful woman in the world.

Without hesitation, Paris awarded the golden apple to Aphrodite. The other goddesses departed in fury, and Prince Paris had unknowingly set in motion events that would lead to the greatest war the ancient world had ever seen. Troy itself would burn because of this judgment.

The shepherd prince would soon discover his true identity as son of King Priam, but the choice made by PARIS on that day would haunt him forever.
