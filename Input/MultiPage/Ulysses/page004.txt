Page 4 – The Origin of Discord

Long before the judgment on Mount Ida, before Paris ever set foot in Sparta, the seeds of war were planted at a divine wedding. Peleus, a mortal hero, was to wed Thetis, a sea nymph, and all the gods were invited to celebrate. All save one.

Eris, goddess of discord and strife, was deliberately excluded from the festivities. The gods feared that her presence would bring chaos to the joyous occasion. But ERIS would not accept such an insult quietly. In her rage, she crafted a plan that would prove more destructive than any direct confrontation.

The golden apple bearing the inscription "To the Fairest" was Goddess Eris's masterstroke. She knew that casting this prize among the assembled deities would ignite jealousy and competition. When Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite each claimed the apple as rightfully theirs, Eris smiled in triumph.

Zeus himself refused to judge between the three powerful goddesses, and so the decision fell to a mortal shepherd on Mount Ida. ERIS had set in motion a chain of events that would lead to the downfall of Troy and the deaths of countless heroes. Discord had won.
