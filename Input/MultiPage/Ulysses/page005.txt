Page 5 – The Reluctant Warrior

Among all the Greek heroes summoned to fight at Troy, none was more reluctant than Odysseus. The king of Ithaca had recently married Penelope and fathered a son, Telemachus. He had no desire to leave his peaceful island kingdom for a war over another man's wife.

When the Greek envoys came to recruit him, Odysseus feigned madness, yoking an ox and a donkey together and plowing his fields with salt. But Palamedes, suspecting deception, placed baby Telemachus in the path of the plow. Ulysses immediately turned aside, revealing his sanity and sealing his fate.

Thus compelled to honor his oath, Odysseus became one of the chief strategists of the Greek army. His cleverness would prove invaluable during the long siege. Where Achilles relied on strength and Ajax on endurance, Ulysses contributed cunning and careful planning.

The king of Ithaca could not know that while the Trojan War would last ten years, his journey home would take ten more. Odysseus would wander the seas, encountering monsters and gods, before finally returning to Penelope and Ithaca. But first, Troy must fall.
